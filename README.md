# Bioinformatics Portfolio

Welcome to my Bioinformatics Portfolio! 
This repository brings together a variety of bioinformatics workflows, 
exercises, analyses, and prototypes that demonstrate my skills in 
computational biology, data analysis, and reproducible research.

## Table of Contents

## Overview

This portfolio showcases my expertise in:

Pipeline Development: Reproducible workflows using Nextflow and QIIME2.
Algorithm Implementation: Manual coding of core bioinformatics algorithms (pattern matching, clump finding, Hamming distance, etc.).
Data Analysis: RNA-Seq differential expression, variant calling, structural analyses.
Visualization: Comprehensive plots including volcano plots, heatmaps, and more.
Automation & Utility: Scripts for data download, parsing, and format conversion.

Each section is organized to highlight different aspects of bioinformatics,
from raw data processing to statistical analysis and reporting.

## Workflows

Nextflow: Automated pipelines for genome analysis and structural variant processing.
QIIME2: 16S metagenomics pipeline with denoising, taxonomy assignment, and visualization.

See the `workflows/` and `metagenomics-workflow/` directories for details and parameters.

## Scripts and Utilities

Located in `scripts/`, these utilities handle:

* Automated downloads of PDB, UniProt, and VCF data.
* Sequence format conversions and parsing.

## Exercises

Classic algorithm implementations in `exercises/`:

* Pattern matching, approximate counting.
* Clump finding, skew calculation.
* k-mer neighborhoods, reverse complements.
* VCF analysis, Hamming distance.

Each script includes examples and usage instructions.

## Results

Final outputs (plots, tables, reports) are stored in `results/`. Highlights:

* Volcano plots and heatmaps for RNA-Seq.
* PDB-based secondary structure bar charts.
* VCF variant classification reports.
