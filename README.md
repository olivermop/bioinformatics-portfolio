Welcome to my Bioinformatics Portfolio! 
This repository brings together a variety of bioinformatics workflows, 
exercises, analyses, and prototypes that demonstrate my skills in 
computational biology, data analysis, and reproducible research.

## Overview

This portfolio showcases my expertise in:

Pipeline Development: Reproducible workflows using Nextflow and QIIME2.
Algorithm Implementation: Manual coding of core bioinformatics algorithms (pattern matching, clump finding, Hamming distance, etc.).
Data Analysis: RNA-Seq differential expression, variant calling, structural analyses.
Visualization: Comprehensive plots including volcano plots, heatmaps, and more.
Automation & Utility: Scripts for data download, parsing, and format conversion.

Each section is organized to highlight different aspects of bioinformatics,
from raw data processing to statistical analysis and reporting.

## Workflows

Nextflow: Automated pipelines for genome analysis and structural variant processing.
QIIME2: 16S metagenomics pipeline with denoising, taxonomy assignment, and visualization.

See the `workflows/` and `metagenomics-workflow/` directories for details and parameters.

## Scripts and Utilities

Located in `scripts/`, these utilities handle:

* Automated downloads of PDB, UniProt, and VCF data.
* Sequence format conversions and parsing.

## Exercises

Hand-coded (and a few extended) bioinformatics algorithms in `exercises/`. Each script is self-contained; where applicable, it exposes a CLI via `argparse` (`--help` available).

### String & motif algorithms
- `hamming_distance.py` — Hamming distance between two strings.
- `reverse_complement.py` — Reverse complement of a DNA string.
- `pattern_occurrence_counter.py` — Exact pattern occurrence counting.
- `patter_matching.py` — Exact pattern matching; returns start indices. *(Suggestion: rename to `pattern_matching.py`)*  
- `approximate_pattern_count.py` — Counts occurrences allowing up to `d` mismatches.
- `approximate_pattern_matching.py` — Start indices of approximate matches (≤ `d` mismatches).
- `d_neighborhood_of_kmer.py` — All k-mers within Hamming distance `d` (the d-neighborhood).
- `frequent_words_with_mismatches.py` — Most frequent k-mers with mismatches.
- `frequent_words_with_mismatches_and_reverse_complements.py` — Same, also considering reverse complements.
- `motif_enumeration.py` — Enumerates shared motifs across strings with ≤ `d` mismatches.
- `median_string.py` — Finds a “median string” motif minimizing total distance.
- `profile_most_probable_kmer.py` — Most probable k-mer given a profile (PWM).
- `profile_probability_tools.py` — Utilities for profiles/probabilities (PWM).
- `randomized_motif_search.py` — Randomized motif discovery.
- `gibbs_sampler.py` — Motif discovery via Gibbs sampling.
- `greedy_motif_search.py` — Greedy motif search.
- `greedy_motif_search_pseudocounts.py` — Greedy search with pseudocounts (Laplace).

### Genomic signals (skew, clumps, ori)
- `calculate_skew.py` — Computes GC skew (G−C) across a genome.
- `minimum_skew.py` — Positions of minimum skew (often near ori).
- `find_ori.py` — Heuristic ori localization using skew.
- `clump_finding.py` / `clump_finding2.py` — (k, L, t) clump detection.
- `expected_kmer_occurrences.py` — Expected k-mer counts under a random model.
- `estimate_ktl.py` — Estimation/tuning of (k, t, L) parameters for clumps/motifs.

### Sequence, RNA-Seq & variation
- `sequence_analysis.py` — General sequence analysis utilities.
- `rna_seq_analysis.py` — Lightweight RNA-Seq pipeline (counts/DE/basic plots).
- `vcf_analysis.py` — VCF parsing and basic variant summaries.
- `genetic_variation_analysis.py` — Additional stats/summaries for variation (complements `vcf_analysis.py`).

### Proteins, BLAST & other
- `protein_translation.py` — DNA/RNA → protein translation.
- `protein_structure_analysis.py` — Basic structural summaries (e.g., secondary structure counts, lengths).
